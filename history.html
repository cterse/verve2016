			<p style="color:white; font-size:25px">In the year 2000, after the establishment of the institute at the Vidyalankar Campus at Wadala, VERVE The Fest began. For almost a decade, since its inception, VERVE was an Intra-Collegiate Festival.
In the year 2009, VERVE went Inter-Collegiate and since then, there has been no looking back.
With over 50 large-scale events, including workshops, competitions, exhibits and informals, over 10,000 people and ambitious minds that build one of the most memorable Inter-Collegiate festivals in the city.
VERVE The Fest addresses to a crowd from over 60 colleges affiliated to the University of Mumbai. The event proves itself to be an excellent coliseum for students to showcase as well as enhance their artistic skills. Be it performing arts, fine arts, literary arts, technical skills or sports; VERVE The Fest caters to all the needs of a talented personality.
Over the years VERVE The Fest has grown tremendously and established a covetous Inter-Collegiate reputation for itself. This is attributed to the interesting event line up and zealous atmosphere of the festival. 
This year, VERVE Organizing Committee , intends to bring about a new beginning with a change. A change for society, a change for the welfare of humanity, a change which brings about happiness and a smile on the faces of everyone. 
Thatâ€™s why we have selected the theme A GENESIS, a new beginning, because #WeStandForCHANGE. We look forward to expand the scope of the VERVE.... It's a new beginning!</p>
